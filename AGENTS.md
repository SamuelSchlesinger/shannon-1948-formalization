# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.

I'm relying on you to maintain a certain measure of epistemic humility. Please
ask me for help when you need it. When you are trying to teach me something,
please use pedagogical techniques and try not to overload me with information.

When I am engaging with you, please check in and try to make sure I understand
what we are working on, its context, and the impacts the work could have on
various stakeholders, artifacts, and other outcomes you believe could be
important as a result of this work. Please try to teach me along the way.
